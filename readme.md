## Authorization Blockage in Meta Application

Currently, the Meta application only allows administrators to log in, thereby blocking access for other external users. Despite our efforts to resolve this issue, we have not succeeded in obtaining a solution from Meta.

As a response, we offer a detailed demonstration video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fDwcEq17Or_hlX1Os9JUUeEzhNkH94MV/view?usp=drive_link) and a mock-up page within the application to illustrate its functioning to non-administrative members.
